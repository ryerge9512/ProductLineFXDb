# ProductLineFXDb
This project was created by Ryan Yerge for the Object-Oriented Programming 
course at Florida Gulf Coast University during the fall semester of the 2019-2020 
school year. The project concept is to create an application for a media player 
production facility to automate the product tracking process. The application
will enhance accuracy of production logs and extends the ability to generate
production reports.

## Key Programming Concepts Utilized

The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture
is the foundation for development of this
application. <br />
<br />
The view handles the user interface and 
experience, UI/UX. This layer was created with
JavaFX's SceneBuilder to generate the .fxml file
and then bridged to the business/database model through
the controller. 
<br />
<br />Fundamental object-oriented paradigm concepts were required to implement
the MVC such as inheritance and encapsulation.
